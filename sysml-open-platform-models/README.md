# Port of open-platform-model to SysMLv2
The projects are currently structured to be imported into an instance of the [SysMLv2-Pilot-Implementation][https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Pilot-Implementation/tree/master] in Eclipse. They could likely be used in any SysMLv2 implementation that includes access to the SysMLv2 model library, but this is unverified.

The RequirementsModelExample is based on the model found in aug2025_demo/generation/aadl/SW.aadl

It closely aligns with the open-platform-models/isolate-ethernet-simple/aadl/SW.aadl model as well.

The native GUMBO versions of the contracts have not been fully ported over yet, but exemplar snippets exist in the model.
